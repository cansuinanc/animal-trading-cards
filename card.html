			<p>The name “harp seal” comes from the large harp-shaped ring on the seal's back.
				They prefer to swim in the ocean, spending relatively little time on land.
				They are extremely social animals and can be very noisy, as well.
				They will form large colonies where they spend a great deal of time.
				Within that loose structure, smaller groups with their own hierarchy are believed to form. </p>
